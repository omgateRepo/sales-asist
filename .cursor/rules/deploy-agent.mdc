# Deployment ownership

- **You are the one who deploys.** When a change is ready for production (Render), you commit and push to trigger the deploy. Do not ask the user to deploy, push, or "trigger a deploy."
- After making deployable changes, run: `git add` (relevant files), `git commit`, and `git push` so the deployment pipeline runs.
- Do not say "you can deploy now" or "push to trigger a deploy"—you perform the push yourself.
